# Web Stack Implementation (LEMP Stack) Project by Itoro Ekpo

> The project LEMP Stack covers similar concepts as that of LAMP and helps to cement my skills of deploying web solutions using LA(E)MP stacks. In this project I will be implementing a similar stack, but with an alternative Web Server-_NGINX_, which is also very popular and widely used by many websites on the internet.
