## Ansible Dynamic Assignments (Include) and Community Roles

In this final Ansible project we will unleash the flexibility of Ansible with dynamic assignments (include) and community roles, expanding our automation capabilities and leveraging pre-built solutions.

The last two projects have equipped us with some knowledge and skills on Ansible so we can perform configurations using `playbooks`, `roles` and `imports`. Now we will proceed with configuring our UAT servers learning and practicing new Ansible concepts and modules.
