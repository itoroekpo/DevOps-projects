Shell scripting is a powerful tool commonly used across industries to automate tasks, test solutions, and increase efficiency. A Shell script is a text file with a list of commands that instruct an operating system to perform certain tasks. A shell is an interface that interprets, processes, and executes these commands from the shell script. It can be particularly helpful to automate repetitive tasks, such as backing up files, monitoring system resources, and managing user accounts, helping to save time and reduce human error. By turning a series of commands into a script, system administrators can save time, increase accuracy, and simplify complex tasks.
