## Automating AWS Infrastructure in code with Terraform

Welcome to the Introduction to [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) Course, focusing on the powerful [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) tool. This comprehensive program is designed to provide you with a solid understanding of [Infrastructure as Code (laC)](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) concepts and practical skills using Terraform. Whether you're a DevOps engineer, system administrator, or IT professional, this course is your gateway to streamlining infrastructure management and deployment. Tailored for beginners, this course takes you on a step-by-step journey into the world of [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code).

We'll learn how [laC](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) revolutionizes infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management by enabling you to define and automate infrastructure using code. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, we'll gain proficiency in leveraging [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to create and manage infrastructure resources across various cloud providers. We'll learn how to write Terraform configurations, define infrastructure dependencies, and implement reusable modules for streamlined infrastructure management. As part of the course, we'll explore advanced topics such as
remote state management, Terraform workspaces, and using Terraform with version control systems. We'll gain insights into Terraform best practices, including techniques for maintaining infrastructure state, managing secrets and orchestrating complex deployments.
